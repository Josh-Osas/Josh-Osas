# Hi there! 👋  
I’m **Joshua**, a Data Analyst and enthusiast for all things data. I specialise in turning numbers into actionable insights, and I’m passionate about keeping things simple and impactful. Whether it's data analysis, management, or stewardship, I love diving deep into data and telling its story.


## These days I’m focused on:  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and more) for in-depth analysis  
- **SQL** for querying and managing data like a pro  
- **Power BI, Tableau, & Google Looker Studio** for creating sleek, useful, & interactive dashboards  
- **Excel** for data manipulation, reporting, and analysis  
- **Data Management & Stewardship** - Ensuring data quality, consistency, and compliance across systems


## My data interest areas are:  
- **Education** – Analysing trends, outcomes, and improvements in education systems  
- **Research** – Working on/with research data to uncover insights and support research initiatives  
- **HR/People Data** – Exploring employee/workforce and organisational data to enhance HR practices  
- **NGO & Sustainability** – Optimising NGO operations and driving sustainable solutions
- **Operations** – Improving efficiency and performance through data insights  
- And more!


## Some projects I’ve worked on:  
- **Educational Data Dashboard** – Using Tableau to visualise student performance and outcomes  


## Fun Facts:  
- I love the heroic feeling I get when I explain complex concepts or solve problems for non-technical individuals or groups, and they are amazed 😉
- I know being a recruiter isn’t easy, especially when it comes to finding the right candidate. That’s why I applied, to save you the stress of searching any further. I’m here for you. 😉
- Outside of work, I enjoy listening to **Jim Rohn** clips (highly recommend them for some motivational wisdom!).
- I’m a huge fan of all things soccer – playing, watching the **English Premier League**, and even playing the video games! ⚽🎮


Feel free to explore my projects, and let’s connect! 😊
